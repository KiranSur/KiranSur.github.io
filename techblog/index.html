        <hr>
        <p class="p-spotlight-abstract-big-blog">
          How powerful are convolutions? What modern computer vision tasks can we achieve through simple frequency manipulation?
          In the status quo where many tasks are ubiquitously pushed to large, generalizable models, constrained tasks
          have become increasingly over-engineered. Let's see what we can do by stripping down to the bare bones of
          image manipulation!
