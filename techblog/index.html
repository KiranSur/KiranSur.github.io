        <p class="p-spotlight-abstract-big-blog">
            In the status quo where many tasks are ubiquitously pushed to large, generalizable models, many constrained tasks
          have become increasingly over-engineered. How powerful are convolutions? Image frequencies? What modern computer vision tasks can we 
          achieve through simple frequency manipulation? Let's see what we can do by stripping down to the bare bones of image manipulation!
