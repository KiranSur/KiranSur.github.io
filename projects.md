Hello! Here are some projects I've worked on :D

[Style/Texture Transfer](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/upload/files/proj6/kirans/)
- Implemented foundational style and texture transfer papers

[Ditto](https://github.com/callaunchpad/Ditto)
- Trained an ML model (CycleGAN/CUT architectures) to convert pictures of pets into pokemon-ified versions!
- Built a [backend](https://github.com/KiranSur/ditto_backend) to host the model online
- A (very compressed/cursed) version can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Launchpad/ditto). The results aren't crazy but were pretty cool for a time right before the big diffusion boom!

[Neural Radiance Fields](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/upload/files/proj5/kirans/)
- Implemented the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) to create 3D views of objects from 2D pictures

[Automatic Mosaic Creation](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/upload/files/proj4B/kirans/)
- Created an end-to-end completely automatic mosaic creation tool (similar to the panoramic creation done by phones!)

[Facial Morphs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/upload/files/proj3/kirans/)
- Used correspondences and transformation matrices to morph between different faces
